# My Brain Sucks, So I Built an AI Assistant

I never know whatâ€™s nextâ€”or the due dates for my homeworkâ€”so I built this thing.  
Itâ€™s like an AI task assistant that stops me from vanishing off the face of the earth.

This isnâ€™t just another boring to-do list app.  
The app reads your calendar, sends desktop notifications, andâ€”hereâ€™s the fun partâ€”uses an LLM (via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai)) to write a sarcastic journal entry of your day when you shut it down.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Nag Mode**  
  Pulls your JSON tasks and sends desktop notifications every 30 minutes so you actually get things done.  

- **AI Journal**  
  When you close the app (`Ctrl+C`), it summarizes your day into a witty productivity log.  

- **Basic GUI**  
  Displays upcoming tasks in a simple window. Backend > frontend here, so donâ€™t expect fancy visuals.
